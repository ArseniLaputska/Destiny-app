# Destiny-app
This is story-adventure app created with implementing the MVC design pattern. 
The app will tell a story depending on what the user chooses and can be fleshed out and modified to provide an engaging story-telling experience.
Also I reviewed here the concept of Swift Structures and using it to separate the Model from Controller.
